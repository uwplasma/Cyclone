Cyclone is a suite of functions which interface with Simsopt to create planar windowpane coils for stellarators. A number of example files are included to show how these functions are used and what they can do. There are functions for creating circular windowpane coils as well as windowpane coils of arbitrary shapes and rotations on user input winding surfaces.
