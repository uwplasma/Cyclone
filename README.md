Cyclone is a suite of functions which interface with Simsopt to create planar windowpane coils for stellarators. A number of example files are included to show how these functions are used and what they can do. There are functions for creating circular windowpane coils as well as windowpane coils of arbitrary shapes and rotations on user input winding surfaces.


Cyclone has recently updated to version 2, greatly expanding its ability to create both planar and nonplanar, windowpane and regular stellarator coils. Example files - as well as example config files for the new method of use - will be added soon in order to show how best to utilize Cyclone with its new features.
