TODO:
- Create a readthedocs for Cyclone.
- Tidy up README to be more accurate and descriptive of the current use cases for Cyclone.
- Create more unit tests to confirm that individual pieces of the code are functional.
- Create regression tests to confirm new updates to the code continue to function to the same extent as previous updates.
- Start measuring code coverage.
- Create GitHub actions to perform all necessary unit and regression tests automatically when new code is pushed.
- Create example .toml files to show basic use cases for the code and how to format configuration files.
- Expand built-in optimization tools to automatically process end of optimization, including updating dofs in dictionary and moving optimization flags forward a step.
- Implement automatic loading in for remaining simsopt existing coil configurations.
- Write direct jacobian function of optimization loop to replace use of jax taking the jacobian.
- Jaxify optimization loop functions to optimize performance.
- Implement more options for built-in optimization tools.
- Create built-in workflows to simplify the process of running optimizations through Cyclone.
- TBD
